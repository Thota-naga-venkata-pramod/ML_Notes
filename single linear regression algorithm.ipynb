        "Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In the case of single linear regression, we have one independent variable and one dependent variable. Here are the steps for implementing a single linear regression algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "Collect data: Gather data for both the independent and dependent variables. The data should be in numerical form.\n",
        "\n",
        "Visualize the data: Plot the data points on a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Split the data: Split the data into two sets: a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the model, and the test set will be used to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Choose a hypothesis: Choose a hypothesis function that describes the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. In single linear regression, this function is a straight line, represented by the equation y = mx + b, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, m is the slope of the line, and b is the intercept.\n",
        "\n",
        "Determine the error: Determine the error between the predicted values of the dependent variable and the actual values. This error is also known as the cost function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Minimize the error: Use an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent, to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Evaluate the model: Use the test set to evaluate the model's performance. Calculate the mean squared error (MSE) or other relevant metrics to determine the accuracy of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use the model: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that there are many variations of the linear regression algorithm, and the above steps provide a general framework for implementing a single linear regression alogorithm"
