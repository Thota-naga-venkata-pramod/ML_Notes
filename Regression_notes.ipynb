        "\n",
        "2)Choose a Regression Algorithm: Choose a regression algorithm based on the problem type and the characteristics of the data. There are various regression algorithms available, such as linear regression, polynomial regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and so on.\n",

        "3)Train the Model: Train the regression model on the training data using the chosen algorithm. The objective is to find the best set of coefficients or parameters that minimize the cost function.\n",

        "2)Number of epochs: This hyperparameter determines how many times the model will cycle through the training data. Increasing the number of epochs can help the model learn more complex patterns in the data, but may also increase the risk of overfitting.\n",

        "3)Regularization parameters: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. There are several types of regularization, including L1 and L2 regularization, and the strength of the regularization can be adjusted using hyperparameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "4)Activation functions: Activation functions are used to introduce non-linearity into the model. There are several activation functions to choose from, including sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU. Choosing the appropriate activation function can significantly impact the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5)Network architecture: The architecture of the neural network can also be adjusted, including the number of layers, the number of nodes in each layer, and the type of layers (e.g., convolutional, recurrent, etc.). Adjusting the network architecture can have a significant impact on the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to fine-tuning a regression model. The optimal hyperparameters will depend on the specific problem, data, and model architecture being used."
